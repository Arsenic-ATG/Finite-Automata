# Finite Automata

The program is focused on implementing `convert ()` function which simply converts a [NFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_finite_automaton) to [DFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton) using [subset construction method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerset_construction)

This is my attempt to create a project based on the philosophy of using [`auto`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/auto) for all the things. The project solely exists for experimental/learning purposes and for me to learn about advantages/disadvantages of using auto everywhere in a C++ project.

Critiques and/or suggestions to improve it are more than welcome.
